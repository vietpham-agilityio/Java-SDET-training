# Getting started with Serenity and Cucumber

Serenity BDD is a library that makes it easier to write high quality automated acceptance tests, with powerful reporting and living documentation features. It has strong support for both web testing with Selenium, and API testing using RestAssured.

Serenity strongly encourages good test automation design, and supports several design patterns, including classic Page Objects, the newer Lean Page Objects/ Action Classes approach, and the more sophisticated and flexible Screenplay pattern.

The latest version of Serenity supports Cucumber 6.x.

## The starter project
The best place to start with Serenity and Cucumber is to clone or download the starter project on Github ([https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-cucumber-starter](https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-cucumber-starter)). This project gives you a basic project setup, along with some sample tests and supporting classes.

### The project directory structure
The project has build scripts for both Maven and Gradle, and follows the standard directory structure used in most Serenity projects:
```Gherkin
src
  + main
    + java
      + actions
      + constants
      + helpers
      + object_behaviors
      + rules
      + pages
  + test
    + java                        Test runners and test steps
    + resources
      + features                  Feature files
        + search                  Feature file subdirectories
             search_by_keyword.feature
```

## The sample scenario
Both variations of the sample project uses the sample Cucumber scenario. In this scenario, User (who likes to search for stuff) is performing a search on the internet:

```Gherkin
Feature: Search by keyword

  Scenario: Searching for a term
    Given user is researching things on the internet
    When user looks up "Cucumber"
    Then user should see information about "Cucumber"
```

### The Action Classes implementation.
These classes are declared using the Serenity `@Steps` annotation, shown below:

```java
import actions.SearchActions;

@Steps
SearchActions searchActions;
```

The `@Steps`annotation tells Serenity to create a new instance of the class, and inject any other steps or page objects that this instance might need.

Each action class models a particular facet of user behaviour: navigating to a particular page, performing a search, or retrieving the results of a search. These classes are designed to be small and self-contained, which makes them more stable and easier to maintain.

The `SearchActions` class is an example of a very simple action class. In a larger application, it might have some other methods related to high level navigation, but in our sample project, it just needs to open the DuckDuckGo home page:

It does this using a standard Serenity Page Object. Page Objects are often very minimal, storing just the URL of the page itself:
The main advantage of the approach used in this example is not in the lines of code written, although Serenity does reduce a lot of the boilerplate code that you would normally need to write in a web test. The real advantage is in the use of many small, stable classes, each of which focuses on a single job. This application of the _Single Responsibility Principle_ goes a long way to making the test code more stable, easier to understand, and easier to maintain.

## Executing the tests
To run the sample project, you can either just run the `CucumberTestSuite` test runner class, or run either `mvn verify` from the command line.

By default, the tests will run using Chrome. You can run them in Firefox by overriding the `driver` system property, e.g.
```json
$ mvn clean verify -Ddriver=firefox
```
Or
```json
$ gradle clean test -Pdriver=firefox
```

The test results will be recorded in the `target/site/serenity` directory.

## Generating the reports
Since the Serenity reports contain aggregate information about all of the tests, they are not generated after each individual test (as this would be extremenly inefficient). Rather, The Full Serenity reports are generated by the `serenity-maven-plugin`. You can trigger this by running `mvn serenity:aggregate` from the command line or from your IDE.

They reports are also integrated into the Maven build process: the following code in the `pom.xml` file causes the reports to be generated automatically once all the tests have completed when you run `mvn verify`?

```
             <plugin>
                <groupId>net.serenity-bdd.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>serenity-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>${serenity.maven.version}</version>
                <configuration>
                    <tags>${tags}</tags>
                </configuration>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <id>serenity-reports</id>
                        <phase>post-integration-test</phase>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>aggregate</goal>
                        </goals>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
```

## Simplified WebDriver configuration and other Serenity extras
The sample projects both use some Serenity features which make configuring the tests easier. In particular, Serenity uses the `serenity.conf` file in the `src/test/resources` directory to configure test execution options.  
### Webdriver configuration
The WebDriver configuration is managed entirely from this file, as illustrated below:
```java
webdriver {
    driver = chrome
}

chrome.switches="""--start-maximized;--test-type;--no-sandbox;--ignore-certificate-errors;
                   --disable-popup-blocking;--disable-default-apps;--disable-extensions-file-access-check;
                   --incognito;--disable-infobars,--disable-gpu"""

```

Serenity uses WebDriverManager to download the WebDriver binaries automatically before the tests are executed.

### Environment-specific configurations
We can also configure environment-specific properties and options, so that the tests can be run in different environments. Here, we configure three environments, __dev__, _staging_ and _prod_, with different starting URLs for each:
```json
environments {
  default {
    webdriver.base.url = "https://duckduckgo.com"
  }
  dev {
    webdriver.base.url = "https://duckduckgo.com/dev"
  }
  staging {
    webdriver.base.url = "https://duckduckgo.com/staging"
  }
  prod {
    webdriver.base.url = "https://duckduckgo.com/prod"
  }
}
```

You use the `environment` system property to determine which environment to run against. For example to run the tests in the staging environment, you could run:
```json
$ mvn clean verify -Denvironment=staging
```
